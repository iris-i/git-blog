Known to every child, elder, and stranger in the village, Marlon was a figure of stories and legends. His deep-set eyes were like the ocean itself—dark, unreadable, and endless. For years, he’d told tales of his adventures, of islands that floated like clouds on the water, of strange beasts in the deep, and of treasures hidden under the sea. But there was one story that he never told anyone, one journey that, until the last days of his life, he kept hidden.",
